"""On-chain copy-trading daemon for Binance Agentic Wallet. Defaults to dry-run; places no real orders.

Sources:   baw tracker ws --address-list / --smy
Execution: audit ∥ live price (concurrent) -> market-order swap -> limit-order SL first + TP
Protection: stop-loss / take-profit are placed as on-chain limit orders and survive process death

DISCLAIMER
    This is a scaffold, not a trading product, and it carries no strategy. The
    bundled hooks are a minimal reference implementation with no evidence of
    positive expectancy. Every risk control, position-management scheme and
    parameter value here is a suggestion, not a safeguard: the daemon runs the
    checks you configure and does not judge whether they are sufficient.

    Nothing here is investment advice. On-chain transactions are irreversible,
    and automated trading can lose money through market conditions you did not
    anticipate, changes in platform behavior, or defects in this software. It is
    provided as-is, without warranty of any kind. You are solely responsible for
    what you run and for any funds you commit.

    It deliberately makes very few judgements, because "which features actually
    predict anything" has to be tested against your own events.jsonl rather than
    copied. Things worth knowing while you design yours:

      · A liquidity floor is meaningful on the address stream; on the signal
        stream it is close to a no-op — the signal source already filters on
        liquidity, so nearly everything passes. Do not rely on it to do your
        filtering.
      · `riskLevel == 0` does not mean "confirmed safe"; it can also mean "not
        yet assessed" (in which case riskLevelEnum is empty). Treating it as an
        allowlist lets unassessed tokens through as if they were safe.
      · Intuitions like "a bigger counterparty buy is more trustworthy" or
        "lower top-10 concentration is better" often do not hold for newly
        launched tokens; thresholds set by feel reject most legitimate candidates.
      · Waiting for "several addresses to agree" costs you the price movement
        during the wait — the later consensus is confirmed, the worse your entry.
        If you want it, first measure how late the second address typically is.
      · Over-rejection looks exactly like "no signals". Before adding any gate,
        make sure you can see what it rejected in the `decision` distribution of
        events.jsonl.

# Caveats worth knowing before you trust the numbers:
#   · These are marks, not fills. No slippage, no fees, no tax, no gas, and no
#     check that the position could actually have been exited at that price.
#     Treat them as an upper bound on what the strategy could have captured.
#   · A horizon only tells you the price at that instant. It does not tell you
#     whether a stop-loss would have been touched first — for that you need the
#     path, so use several horizons and read them together.
#   · Pending samples are persisted in state.json, so a restart does not lose

def acquire_lock():

    A duplicate start means two WS streams, double orders, and two processes
    overwriting each other's state.json — under live mode that is literally
    double position sizing, so this has to be airtight.

    Why flock rather than a pidfile check:
      · `os.path.exists()` followed by a write is a TOCTOU window — two
        processes starting together both see no file and both proceed.
      · O_CREAT|O_EXCL closes that window for creation, but "create the file"
        and "write the pid into it" are still two steps, so a second process can
        read a momentarily empty file, judge it corrupt, delete it, and take the
        lock. (Observed while testing the O_EXCL version: 12 concurrent
        attempts, 3 winners.)
      · flock is a single kernel-arbitrated operation with no such window, and
        the kernel releases it when the holder dies — which removes the whole
        notion of a stale lock that has to be detected and cleaned up.

    The pid is still written into the file, purely so a human can see who holds
    it. Exclusivity does not depend on that content.

    POSIX only (Linux/macOS), consistent with the rest of this script.

    Editing `"mode": "live"` in a JSON file is a single character of difference

    between "I am testing" and "I am funding an unvalidated strategy with real
    money" would otherwise be one keystroke.

    The acknowledgement file must contain the current `budget_usd`. That gives
    three properties worth having:
      · it cannot be inherited by copying someone else's runtime directory —
        a different budget makes the file invalid
      · the number has to come from whoever decided it, so the acknowledgement
        is about a specific amount rather than a vague "yes"
      · raising the budget invalidates it, which is correct: more money at risk
        deserves a fresh decision, not a stale one

    An agent may write this file on the operator's behalf **after** the operator
    has confirmed the amount. The point is that the confirmation happened and
    was about this number, not that a human typed the command.
